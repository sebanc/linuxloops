# Distributions specific notes

### Specific note for almalinux installation in a disk image with secure boot enabled

Disk images use the actual almalinux secure boot key. When the almalinux secure boot key changes which should be very rare, you will need to disable secure boot temporarily and enroll the new key with mokutil by running:  
```
sudo cp /usr/share/pki/sb-certs/secureboot-kernel-x86_64.cer /etc/secureboot_key/MOK.der
sudo mokutil --import /etc/secureboot_keys/MOK.der
```
Reboot, enroll the key in shim and re-enable secureboot.

## SteamOS

SteamOS installed from the SteamOS packages repository (https://steamdeck-packages.steamos.cloud/archlinux-mirror/) with minor adjustments to support standard computers usage.  
Packages can be installed and updated with pacman, however native packages available in the SteamOS packages repository are not the latest versions, therefore for sensitive apps such as web browsers and such it is recommended to use the flatpak version (available by default in the Discover app).  

2 environments are available:  
- Desktop: Boots to Plasma session. The gamescope session can be launched within Plasma through the "SteamDeck Session" shortcut (in "Game" section).  
- Gamescope: Same as the SteamDeck. Boots directly into the SteamOS session. Plasma can be launched with the "Switch to Desktop" SteamOS option.  


## Tails

Tails disk images can only be installed on ext4 partitions (due to the lack of kernel modules for ntfs / exfat support in its initramfs).
